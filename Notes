Implement the Backend:
Firebase SDK Integration
Extend Current Firebase Setup

    You already have Firebase initialized in firebase.js with analytics
    Import additional Firebase services as needed:
        Authentication (for user management)
        Firestore (for database)
        Storage (for images/files)
        Functions (for serverless backend)

Context Provider Approach
    - Create a Firebase context provider to make Firebase services accessible throughout your app
    - This prevents redundant initialization and provides clean access to services

Authentication Flow
    - Implement auth state listener to track user status
    - Create protected routes that require authentication
    - Store user preferences in Firestore linked to user accounts

Data Management
    - Use Firestore for storing meal plans, user preferences, and recipe collections
    - Create custom hooks for data fetching and mutations
    - Implement offline capabilities for better user experience


AI Tooling Integration
    Option 1: Firebase Extensions
        Use Firebase Extensions like "Trigger OpenAI" to connect Firebase with AI services
        This provides a managed integration without complex setup

    Option 2: Firebase Functions + AI APIs
        Create serverless functions in your existing index.js
        Connect to OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, or other AI providers through these functions
        Keep API keys secure in environment variables

    Key AI Features to Implement
        Meal recommendation system based on user preferences/restrictions
        Custom recipe generation with nutritional calculations
        Ingredient substitution suggestions
        Natural language query processing for recipe search

    Client-Server Architecture
        Keep AI processing on the server side (Firebase Functions)
        Send prompts/requests from the client
        Cache common AI responses in Firestore for performance

Implementation Strategy

    Start with Authentication /
        Enable authentication in Firebase console
        Implement authentication flow before AI features

    Build Data Structure
        Design your Firestore schema for users, recipes, meal plans, etc.
        Create security rules to protect data

    Create Serverless Functions
        Develop functions for AI operations one by one
        Test thoroughly before connecting to frontend

    Connect Frontend
        Use React hooks to interact with Firebase services
        Implement loading states and error handling

    Optimize
        Add caching strategies
        Implement pagination and query optimization
